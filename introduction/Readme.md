###Part1
name = raw_input("Hey what's your name?\n")



`import division in python 2`
`from __future__ import division`
print 4/3
1.3333333333333333 
print 4//3
1


###Divmod function


One of the built-in functions of Python is divmod, which takes two arguments 
a
 and 
b
 and returns a tuple containing the quotient of 
a/b
 first and then the remainder 
a
.
For example:
`print divmod(177,10)
(17, 7)`



###Power- Mod power
`
pow(a,b) 
or
a**b
It's also possible to calculate 
a
b
modm
.
pow(a,b,m)`  
This is very helpful in computations where you have to print the resultant % mod.


###range function
Here, the term range(0,5) returns a list of integers from 0 to 5: [0,1,2,3,4]
`for i in range(0,5):
    print i`
    
###dictionary 
Note: The key of a dictionary is immutable. We cannot use a list as a key because a list is mutable.

`````

a['two'] = 2 # Adds key 'two' which points to 2
a['one'] = 1  
if ('three' in a):
      # To check whether a certain string exist as a key in the dictionary  
print a['three']
else:  
    print "Three not there"
Three not there
del a['one']
Deletes index 'one' and the value associated with it  a
{'two': 2}


``````

###finding the percentage
.spilt(' ') can be used to split the input

print "%.2f" % float(sum_total/totalelements)


###print tricks
`print i,`
will only print them in the same line

var, var1, var2 = 1,2,3
quick assignment

*  sep defines the delimiter between the values

-  end defines what to print after the values. 

-  file defines the output stream.

`print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout)`

print(item, end=" ") in Python 3
