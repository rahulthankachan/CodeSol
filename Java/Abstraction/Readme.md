##Abstraction

**Interfaces and abstract**

The What Part of the methods is **SAME** the **HOW** part of the methods is different.

1. Not allowed to create objects from an interface
2. The keyword to be used for overriding is **"Override"**
3. ABSTRACT METHODS can also be defined inside a class **BUT** if done then the class has to be defined as abstract also.


`NOTE` Abstarct class method is almost same to the iterface method

1. We have to use the abstract keyword in the class definition
2. We have to use the extends keyword instead of the implements keyword.
