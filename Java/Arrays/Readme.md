##Arrays

An array is a container object which is of **FIXED** size and can have elements of the **SAME** type only.

Declarations of arrays in Java

`int[] integerArray;`

`float[] floatArray;`

Also all the araay variables are object references even if they contain primitive data types.


####Initialization an Array

*  Initially it is pointing to a NULL value
*  Also when creating a new array all the elements in the array are given a **default value based on the type of the DATA**
*  Example `int[] integerArray = new int[5]` An array with 5 elements and each of the elements in the array is equal to zero
*  Incase of **Array of objects** then all of the elements in the array will point to the default value and that is **NULL**


#####length of the array can be found 

***array.length***

Note that there is **NO** bracket in case of this


####COOL THING

Shorthand method of creating an array 

`new int[]{1,2,3,4}`

Another way to define an Array

`int[] myArray = new int[5]`


####For-each loop

````
for(int x : arrayName) {

}

````

####Two-Dimensional arrays
