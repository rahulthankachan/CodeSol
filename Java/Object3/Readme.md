## Objects 3

###Access Modifiers

1. Public All available completely
2. Default Are available to all the classes within the same package
3. Private Are available within the class only

As a general convention all the member variables are given the `private access `variables and we use the 

1. get-Variable name-
2. set-Variable name-

To set the values for the variables.



###IMP:

Do not go inside the package to run the Class

instead use the command for the Package

`javac -cp . packagename/Classname`
