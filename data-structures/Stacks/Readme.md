##Stacks


###Maximum

Important Steps

*  Maintain a list of all the maximum values also
*  Make sure to add the **equal values to the list of maximum**
*  Create another list to store all the values of the stack
*  Use the pop() method to pop
*  **Make sure when we pop then we see that we pop the element from the maximum list in case the element is same**
