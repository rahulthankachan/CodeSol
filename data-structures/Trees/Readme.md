###Binary Tree:

A binary tree is a tree which is characterized by any one of the following properties:

*  It can be an empty (null).
*  It contains a root node and two subtrees, left subtree and right subtree. 
*  These subtrees are also binary tree.

**Traversal**

1. Visit the left Node 
2. Visit the root Node
3. Visit the Right Node

**Depth**
We define depth of a node as follow:

*  Root node is at depth 1.
*  If the depth of parent node is d, then the depth of current node wll be d+1.
