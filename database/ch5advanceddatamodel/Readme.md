##Advanced Modelling


###EERM - Extended Entity Relationship Model


####Entity supertype: 
Generic entity type related to one or more entity subtype 

####Entity Subtype:
Contains unique characteristics of each entity subtype.


###Subtypes Constraints

1. Disjoint Subtypes(d)
2. Overlapping subtypes(o)


###Completeness Constraints

1. **Partial Completeness** Every supertype occurance may not be member of a subtype
2. **Total Completeness** Every supertype occurance must be a part of one of the


###Entity Cluster
Virtual ENTITY type used to represent **multiple entities and relationships** in an ERD.


###Uses of Composite Keys

1. Identifiers of composite entities.
2. Identifiers of weak entities and strong relationships.

###Surrogate Key

Primary key chosen to simplify the identification of entity instances.
When,

1. No Natural Key,
2. Selected candidate key has embedded semantic or is too long
