##Data Mining
Data mining is essentially extracting useful information.

1.  **Relationships** happening over a time is called a `Pattern`

2. The term **'trend'** is used to describe patterns that **occur or change over time**.

3. Summarizing the data is a nice way.



####Model

1. Finding the parameters
2. Curve or finding an equation
3. Fitting
4. 




####Learning

Learning will always have 2 sets

1. Creating a model for which you know everything
2. Predicting

This is where it is different from data mining.


###Data Mining Algorithms

Almost all the data mining algorithms fit in the four categories.

1. Classification `Labeling of the data - Maybe Yes/NO`
2. Clustering - Eg on 2d (`Fitting`)
3. Regression  - `Fitting an equation to describe the data`
4. Rule Extraction - Loose relation  



###C.45 (Decision Tree Algorithm)

Depends on a tred: Weather

`Disjunction of Conjunctions`


###K- Means Clustering

1. K means is where we define the number of clusters
2. Unsupervised learning
3. Randomly chooses the Centroid and then makes it better


### Support Vector Machine(SVM) - Classification

#####HERE ALSO WE HAVE MULTI DIMENSIONAL DATA

One Goal -  `You slice the data in 2 parts and exactly 2 parts.`


### Apriori - Rules (Association)

Support = (number of occurences of the itemset) / total number
