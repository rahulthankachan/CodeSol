##Connectivity


####Chapter 14

Connection with the database.

1. **Database Middleware**: Provides an interface between the application and the database.


Solutions

Native API - Every vendor has its own API to connect to SQL.


JDBC - > Java data base connectivity
 
 
###Microsoft Technologies
 
 1. **ODBC** Open Database connectivity. Very low level
 2. **DAO** Data access Objects
 3. **Remote Data Objects** - Object oriented application interface for accessing the remote database servers
 
###DLL - Dynamic Link Libraries

1. Implements ODBS, RDO, DAO as **shared code** that is dynamically  linked to the Windows Operating system
 
###Next generation Object linking and embedding

**COM** - Common object level is what used by OLE.

**OLE -DB** Charts could be linked to databases


###ADO (ActiveX data Objects)
1. Higher level interface for the scripting languages.
2. ActiveX would be written on top of the OLE - DB


###ADO.net

(Write code in any programming language) -> CLI 

1. Set of calls or API which are provided.
2. Consists of the commands on the left side and the actual data in the XML format.
3. EXTRA: Any application like Excel can read the xml DATA and any changes that are done in the excel program are automatically reflected back in the Microsoft Database




##Java Database Connectivity(JDBC)


###Server Side Extension
1. Program that interacts directly with the web - server\
2. Also known as the web - to - database middleware
3. Totally **transparent** to the client browser
4. 


###Database Internet Connectivity

CGI - Common gateway Interface PERL


###Web Applications Server

Middleware expands the functionality of the web servers.

1. It is a specialized server that interfaces with the specialized web services such as database, search engine. 
2. The client can query these data sources and get the results dynamically.


FEATURES

1. security
2. Access to multiple services
3. IDE
4. Computational language
5. Perfomance and fault tolerance
6. Database access with trasaction management capability.
