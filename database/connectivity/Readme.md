###Microsoft Technologies
 
 1. **ODBC** Open Database connectivity. Very low level
 2. **DAO** Data access Objects
 3. **Remote Data Objects** - Object oriented application interface for accessing the remote database servers
 
 
 
###Next generation Object linking and embedding

**COM** - Common object level is what used by OLE.

**OLE -DB** Charts could be linked to databases


###ADO (ActiveX data Objects)
1. Higher level interface for the scripting languages.
2. ActiveX would be written on top of the OLE - DB


###ADO.net

(Write code in any programming language) -> CLI 

1. Set of calls or API which are provided.
2. Consists of the commands on the left side and the actual data in the XML format.
3. EXTRA: Any application like Excel can read the xml DATA and any changes that are done in the excel program are automatically reflected back in the Microsoft Database




##Java Database Connectivity(JDBC)




###Database Internet Connectivity

CGI - Common gateway Interface PERL
