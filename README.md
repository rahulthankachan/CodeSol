####Welcome to Codesol

This is a repository where I try and post python based solutions to the [HackerRank](http://hackerrank.com) questions.

Some people will argue that most of the discussions can happen within the platform. While that is true I think we can leverage the power of Github also.

####Main objectives 
1. To learn and share code
2. Discuss best solutions


###Requirements

1. Python 3+
2. A decent laptop :P


Yay! lets code :)
