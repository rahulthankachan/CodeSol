####Welcome to CodeSol

This is a repository where I try and post python based solutions to the [HackerRank](http://hackerrank.com) questions.

Some people will argue that most of the discussions can happen within the platform. While that is true I think we can leverage the power of Github also.

####Main objectives 
1. To learn and share code
2. Discuss best solutions


###Requirements

1. Python 3+
2. A decent laptop :P


###Change of Scope and why?

*  After some interviews and coding challenges what I believe is that majority of them are Java based :(
*  I will start coding in Java also and post solutions in Java too.
*  But since I love python I will continue using it as a tool for myself.


**Changes** 

1. New Java section to be added
2. Also since this requires some learning from my side I would post extra folders which are not in sync with the Hackerrank folder structure


Yay! lets code :)
